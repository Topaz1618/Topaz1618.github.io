<h3 id="c12"> 1.2 Necessary Plugins for Jenkins </h3>
If you want to set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, you will need to install some plugins to support the various stages of the pipeline. Here are some plugins that are commonly used in CI/CD pipelines:

- Git Plugin: This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Git repositories, enabling you to check out code from a repository, push changes, and trigger builds based on Git events.
- Pipeline Plugin: This plugin enables you to define your CI/CD pipeline as a script, which can be stored in a Jenkinsfile in your code repository. It provides a powerful syntax for defining build stages, integrating with other plugins, and executing shell commands.
- Docker Pipeline Plugin: This plugin allows Jenkins to build, tag, and push Docker images as part of your CI/CD pipeline. It provides a syntax for defining Dockerfile instructions and integrating with Docker Compose.
- Credentials Plugin: This plugin enables Jenkins to securely store and manage credentials, such as usernames and passwords, SSH keys, and API tokens.
- Build Timeout Plugin: This plugin allows you to set a maximum time limit for each build stage, which can help prevent builds from hanging indefinitely and consuming resources.
- Slack Notification Plugin: This plugin enables Jenkins to send notifications to Slack channels or users, providing real-time feedback on build status, failures, and other events.
