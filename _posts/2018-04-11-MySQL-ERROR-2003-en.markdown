<h1 class="title"> MySQL ERROR 2003 Troubleshooting </h1>
### Problem：
MySQL connection raise an error
{% highlight html %}
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server (111)
{% endhighlight %}

### Background
1.MySQL was working normal before the server went down

2.Local environment can connect to MySQL normally

3.The MySQL configuration has not been modified, so the configuration is also normal

### Troubleshooting steps
1.Check configuration file
 {% highlight html %}
 [root@Topaz ~]# cat /etc/my.cnf
 port = 3306
 bind-address = 0.0.0.0
 #skip-networking
 {% endhighlight %}
Several parameters that will cause the remote connection to be failed are all look good


2.Ping from another server
 {% highlight html %}
 [root@web ~]# ping 10.0.0.129
 	PING 10.0.0.129 (10.0.0.129) 56(84) bytes of data.
 	64 bytes from 10.0.0.129: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=4.14 ms
 {% endhighlight %}
Can ping successfully

3.telnet port，oops got an error
 {% highlight html %}
 [root@web ~]# telnet 10.0.0.129 3306
 	telnet: connect to address 10.0.0.129: No route to host
 {% endhighlight %}

4.iptables -L check the firewall

5.Finally, it is determined that it is a problem with the firewall. Delete the routing rule that caused the error.
